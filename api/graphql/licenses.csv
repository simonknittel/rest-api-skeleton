Features comprehensive test coverage (over 100,000 tests) which cover pretty much all conceivable cases.  Compatible with [bluebird](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bluebird) v2.x and v3.x. Tests cover both versions.  Please use with latest version of [bluebird](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bluebird) in either v2.x or v3.x branches. Older versions are not guaranteed to work.  ## Usage  ### `clsBluebird( ns [, Promise] )`  ```js var cls = require('continuation-local-storage'); var ns = cls.createNamespace('myNamespace');  var Promise = require('bluebird'); var clsBluebird = require('cls-bluebird');  clsBluebird( ns ); // Promise is now patched to maintain CLS context ```  The above patches the 'global' instance of bluebird. So anywhere else in the same app that calls `require('bluebird')` will get the patched version (assuming npm resolves to the same file).  ### Patching a particular instance of Bluebird  So as not to alter the 'global' instance of bluebird, it's recommended to first create a independent instance of the Bluebird constructor before patching, and pass it to cls-bluebird.  This is a more robust approach.  ```js var Promise = require('bluebird').getNewLibraryCopy(); var clsBluebird = require('cls-bluebird');  clsBluebird( ns, Promise ); ```  (see [Promise.getNewLibraryCopy()](http://bluebirdjs.com/docs/api/promise.getnewlibrarycopy.html) docs on Bluebird website)  ### Nature of patching  Combining CLS and promises is a slightly tricky business. There are 3 different conventions one could use (see [this issue](https://github.com/othiym23/node-continuation-local-storage/issues/64) for more detail).  `cls-bluebird` follows the convention of binding `.then()` callbacks **to the context in which `.then()` is called**.  ```js var promise; ns.run(function() {     ns.set('foo', 123);     promise = Promise.resolve(); });  ns.run(function() {     ns.set('foo', 456);     promise.then(print); });  function print() {     console.log(ns.get('foo')); }  // this outputs '456' (the value of `foo` at the time `.then()` was called) ```  ### Notes  #### Coroutines  The patch ensures that when execution in a coroutine continues after a `yield` statement, it always does so in the CLS context *in which the coroutine started running*.  ```js var fn = Promise.coroutine(function* () {     console.log('Context 1:', ns.get('foo'));     yield Promise.resolve();     console.log('Context 2:', ns.get('foo')); });  ns.run(function(ctx) {     ns.set('foo', 123);     fn(); }); ```  outputs:  ``` Context 1: 123 Context 2: 123 ```  This means:  1. If the `yield`-ed expression loses CLS context, the original CLS context will be restored after the `yield`. 2. Any code before the `yield` which changes CLS context will only be effective until the next `yield`.  #### Global error handlers  `Promise.onPossiblyUnhandledRejection()` and `Promise.onUnhandledRejectionHandled()` allow you to attach global handlers to intercept unhandled rejections.  The CLS context in which callbacks are called is unknown. It's probably unwise to rely on the CLS context in the callback being that when the rejection occurred - use `.catch()` on the end of the promise chain that's created within `namespace.run()` instead.  #### Progression  Bluebird v2.x contains a deprecated API for handling progression (`.progressed()`) etc. These methods are patched and *should* work fine but they're not covered by the tests.  ## Tests  The tests cover every possible combination of input promises and callbacks that the Bluebird API allows. There's around 100,000 tests in total and the aim is to ensure cls-bluebird is as robust and reliable as possible.  Use `npm test` to run the tests. Use `npm run cover` to check coverage.  For more info on test tests, see [tests/README.md](https://github.com/TimBeyer/cls-bluebird/blob/master/test/README.md)  ## Changelog  See [changelog.md](https://github.com/TimBeyer/cls-bluebird/blob/master/changelog.md)  ## Issues/bugs  If you discover a bug, please raise an issue on Github. https://github.com/TimBeyer/cls-bluebird/issues  We are very keen to ensure cls-bluebird is completely bug-free and any bugs discovered will be fixed as soon as possible.  ## Contribution  Pull requests are very welcome. Please:  * ensure all tests pass before submitting PR * add an entry to changelog * add tests for new features * document new functionality/API additions in README"

It can also wrap normal functions via the old-fashioned way.  Transpilers supported:  - **TypeScript** with `experimentalDecorators` option enabled. - **Babel** with [transform-decorators-legacy](https://github.com/loganfsmyth/babel-plugin-transform-decorators-legacy) for version 6.x.  ## Install  ```sh npm install deprecated-decorator --save ```  ## API References  ```ts export declare type DeprecatedDecorator = ClassDecorator & PropertyDecorator;  export interface DeprecatedOptions {     alternative?: string;     version?: string;     url?: string; }  export declare function deprecated(options?: DeprecatedOptions): DeprecatedDecorator; export declare function deprecated(alternative?: string, version?: string, url?: string): DeprecatedDecorator;  export declare function deprecated<T extends Function>(fn: T): T; export declare function deprecated<T extends Function>(options: DeprecatedOptions, fn: T): T; export declare function deprecated<T extends Function>(alternative: string, fn: T): T; export declare function deprecated<T extends Function>(alternative: string, version: string, fn: T): T; export declare function deprecated<T extends Function>(alternative: string, version: string, url: string, fn: T): T;  export default deprecated; ```  ## Usage  Decorating a class will enable warning on constructor and static methods (including static getters and setters):  ```ts import deprecated from 'deprecated-decorator';  // alternative, since version, url @deprecated('Bar', '0.1.0', 'http://vane.life/') class Foo {     static method() { } } ```  Or you can decorate methods respectively:  ```ts import deprecated from 'deprecated-decorator';  class Foo {     @deprecated('otherMethod')     method() { }          @deprecated({         alternative: 'otherProperty',         version: '0.1.2',         url: 'http://vane.life/'     })     get property() { } } ```  For functions:  ```ts import deprecated from 'deprecated-decorator';  let foo = deprecated({     alternative: 'bar',     version: '0.1.0' }, function foo() {     // ... }); ```  ## License  MIT License."

"fs-capacitor@2.0.4","MIT","","https://github.com/mike-marcacci/fs-capacitor","[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/mike-marcacci/fs-capacitor.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mike-marcacci/fs-capacitor) [![Current version](https://badgen.net/npm/v/fs-capacitor)](https://npm.im/fs-capacitor) ![Supported Node.js versions](https://badgen.net/npm/node/fs-capacitor)  # FS Capacitor  FS Capacitor is a filesystem buffer for finite node streams. It supports simultaneous read/write, and can be used to create multiple independent readable streams, each starting at the beginning of the buffer.  This is useful for file uploads and other situations where you want to avoid delays to the source stream, but have slow downstream transformations to apply:  ```js import fs from 'fs'; import http from 'http'; import WriteStream from 'fs-capacitor';  http.createServer((req, res) => {   const capacitor = new WriteStream();   const destination = fs.createReadStream('destination.txt');    // pipe data to the capacitor   req.pipe(capacitor);    // read data from the capacitor   capacitor     .createReadStream()     .pipe(/* some slow Transform streams here */)     .pipe(destination);    // read data from the very beginning   setTimeout(() => {     capacitor.createReadStream().pipe(/* elsewhere */);      // you can destroy a capacitor as soon as no more read streams are needed     // without worrying if existing streams are fully consumed     capacitor.destroy();   }, 100); }); ```  It is especially important to use cases like [`graphql-upload`](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-upload) where server code may need to stash earler parts of a stream until later parts have been processed, and needs to attach multiple consumers at different times.  FS Capacitor creates its temporary files in the directory ideneified by `os.tmpdir()` and attempts to remove them:  - after `readStream.destroy()` has been called and all read streams are fully consumed or destroyed - before the process exits  Please do note that FS Capacitor does NOT release disk space _as data is consumed_, and therefore is not suitable for use with infinite streams or those larger than the filesystem.  ## API  ### WriteStream  `WriteStream` inherets all the methods of [`fs.WriteStream`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_writestream)  #### `new WriteStream()`  Create a new `WriteStream` instance.  #### `.createReadStream(): ReadStream`  Create a new `ReadStream` instance attached to the `WriteStream` instance.  Once a `WriteStream` is fully destroyed, calling `.createReadStream()` will throw a `ReadAfterDestroyedError` error.  As soon as a `ReadStream` ends or is closed (such as by calling `readStream.destroy()`), it is detached from its `WriteStream`.  #### `.destroy(error?: ?Error): void`  - If `error` is present, `WriteStream`s still attached are destroyed with the same error. - If `error` is null or undefined, destruction of underlying resources is delayed until no `ReadStream`s are attached the `WriteStream` instance.  ### ReadStream  `ReadStream` inherets all the methods of [`fs.ReadStream`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_readstream)."

"graphql-upload@8.1.0","MIT","","https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-upload","![graphql-upload logo](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jaydenseric/graphql-upload@8.0.0/graphql-upload-logo.svg)  # graphql-upload  [![npm version](https://badgen.net/npm/v/graphql-upload)](https://npm.im/graphql-upload) [![CI status](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-upload/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-upload/actions)  Middleware and an [`Upload` scalar](#class-graphqlupload) to add support for [GraphQL multipart requests](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec) (file uploads via queries and mutations) to various Node.js GraphQL servers.  ⚠️ Previously published as [`apollo-upload-server`](https://npm.im/apollo-upload-server).  ## Support  The following environments are known to be compatible:  - Node.js v8.5+   - CJS   - Native ESM with [`--experimental-modules`](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#esm_enabling) - [Koa](https://koajs.com)   - [`graphql-api-koa`](https://npm.im/graphql-api-koa)   - [`koa-graphql`](https://npm.im/koa-graphql)   - [`apollo-server-koa`](https://npm.im/apollo-server-koa) (inbuilt) - [Express](https://expressjs.com)   - [`express-graphql`](https://npm.im/express-graphql)   - [`apollo-server-express`](https://npm.im/apollo-server-express) (inbuilt)  See also [GraphQL multipart request spec server implementations](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec#server).  ## Setup  Setup is necessary if your environment doesn’t feature this package inbuilt (see **_[Support](#support)_**).  To install [`graphql-upload`](https://npm.im/graphql-upload) and the [`graphql`](https://npm.im/graphql) peer dependency from [npm](https://npmjs.com) run:  ```shell npm install graphql-upload graphql ```  Use the [`graphqlUploadKoa`](#function-graphqluploadkoa) or [`graphqlUploadExpress`](#function-graphqluploadexpress) middleware just before GraphQL middleware. Alternatively, use [`processRequest`](#function-processrequest) to create custom middleware.  A schema built with separate SDL and resolvers (e.g. using [`makeExecutableSchema`](https://apollographql.com/docs/graphql-tools/generate-schema#makeExecutableSchema)) requires the [`Upload` scalar](#class-graphqlupload) to be setup.  ## Usage  [Clients implementing the GraphQL multipart request spec](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec#client) upload files as [`Upload` scalar](#class-graphqlupload) query or mutation variables. Their resolver values are promises that resolve [file upload details](#type-fileupload) for processing and storage. Files are typically streamed into cloud storage but may also be stored in the filesystem.  See the [example API and client](https://github.com/jaydenseric/apollo-upload-examples).  ### Tips  - The process must have both read and write access to the directory identified by [`os.tmpdir()`](https://nodejs.org/api/os.html#os_os_tmpdir). - The device requires sufficient disk space to buffer the expected number of concurrent upload requests. - Promisify and await file upload streams in resolvers or the server will send a response to the client before uploads are complete, causing a disconnect. - Handle file upload promise rejection and stream errors; uploads sometimes fail due to network connectivity issues or impatient users disconnecting. - Process multiple uploads asynchronously with [`Promise.all`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/web/javascript/reference/global_objects/promise/all) or a more flexible solution where an error in one does not reject them all. - Only use [`createReadStream()`](#type-fileupload) _before_ the resolver returns; late calls (e.g. in an unawaited async function or callback) throw an error. Existing streams can still be used after a response is sent, although there are few valid reasons for not awaiting their completion. - Use [`stream.destroy()`](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_readable_destroy_error) when an incomplete stream is no longer needed, or temporary files may not get cleaned up.  ## Architecture  The [GraphQL multipart request spec](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec) allows a file to be used for multiple query or mutation variables (file deduplication), and for variables to be used in multiple places. GraphQL resolvers need to be able to manage independent file streams. As resolvers are executed asynchronously, it’s possible they will try to process files in a different order than received in the multipart request.  [`busboy`](https://npm.im/busboy) parses multipart request streams. Once the `operations` and `map` fields have been parsed, [`Upload` scalar](#class-graphqlupload) values in the GraphQL operations are populated with promises, and the operations are passed down the middleware chain to GraphQL resolvers.  [`fs-capacitor`](https://npm.im/fs-capacitor) is used to buffer file uploads to the filesystem and coordinate simultaneous reading and writing. As soon as a file upload’s contents begins streaming, its data begins buffering to the filesystem and its associated promise resolves. GraphQL resolvers can then create new streams from the buffer by calling [`createReadStream()`](#type-fileupload). The buffer is destroyed once all streams have ended or closed and the server has responded to the request. Any remaining buffer files will be cleaned when the process exits.  ## API  ### Table of contents  - [class GraphQLUpload](#class-graphqlupload) - [function graphqlUploadExpress](#function-graphqluploadexpress) - [function graphqlUploadKoa](#function-graphqluploadkoa) - [function processRequest](#function-processrequest) - [type FileUpload](#type-fileupload) - [type GraphQLOperation](#type-graphqloperation) - [type ProcessRequestFunction](#type-processrequestfunction) - [type ProcessRequestOptions](#type-processrequestoptions)  ### class GraphQLUpload  A GraphQL `Upload` scalar that can be used in a [`GraphQLSchema`](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/type/#graphqlschema). It’s value in resolvers is a promise that resolves [file upload details](#type-fileupload) for processing and storage.  #### Examples  _Setup for a schema built with [`makeExecutableSchema`](https://apollographql.com/docs/graphql-tools/generate-schema#makeExecutableSchema)._  > ```js > import { makeExecutableSchema } from 'graphql-tools' > import { GraphQLUpload } from 'graphql-upload' > > const typeDefs = ` >   scalar Upload > ` > > const resolvers = { >   Upload: GraphQLUpload > } > > export const schema = makeExecutableSchema({ typeDefs, resolvers }) > ```  _A manually constructed schema with an image upload mutation._  > ```js > import { GraphQLSchema, GraphQLObjectType, GraphQLBoolean } from 'graphql' > import { GraphQLUpload } from 'graphql-upload' > > export const schema = new GraphQLSchema({ >   mutation: new GraphQLObjectType({ >     name: 'Mutation', >     fields: { >       uploadImage: { >         description: 'Uploads an image.', >         type: GraphQLBoolean, >         args: { >           image: { >             description: 'Image file.', >             type: GraphQLUpload >           } >         }, >         async resolve(parent, { image }) { >           const { filename, mimetype, createReadStream } = await image >           const stream = createReadStream() >           // Promisify the stream and store the file, then… >           return true >         } >       } >     } >   }) > }) > ```  ---  ### function graphqlUploadExpress  Creates [Express](https://expressjs.com) middleware that processes [GraphQL multipart requests](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec) using [`processRequest`](#function-processrequest), ignoring non-multipart requests.

'Derivative Works' shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain       separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,       the Work and Derivative Works thereof.        'Contribution' shall mean any work of authorship, including       the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions       to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally       submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner       or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of       the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, 'submitted'       means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent       to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to       communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,       and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the       Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but       excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise       designated in writing by the copyright owner as 'Not a Contribution.'        'Contributor' shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity       on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and       subsequently incorporated within the Work.     2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable       copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,       publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the       Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.     3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,       where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate       as of the date such litigation is filed.     4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You       meet the following conditions:        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices           stating that You changed the files; and        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of           the Derivative Works; and        (d) If the Work includes a 'NOTICE' text file as part of its           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed           as modifying the License.        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with       the conditions stated in this License.     5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an 'AS IS' BASIS,       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.     8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.     9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

"packet-reader@1.0.0","MIT","Copyright 2015 Brian M. Carlson. All rights reserved.","https://github.com/brianc/node-packet-reader","node-packet-reader ==================  Handy little well tested module for reading length-prefixed binary packets.  Since buffers come off a socket in randomly sized chunks you can't expect them to cleanly break on packet boundaries.  This module allows you to push buffers in and read full packets out the other side, so you can get to parsing right away and not have to manage concatenating partial buffers and searching through them for packets.  ## install  ` $ npm install packet-reader `  ## example  ```js var Reader = require('packet-reader')  var reader = new Reader() //assuming you have a socket emitting `data` events socket.on('data', function(buffer) {   reader.addChunk(buffer)   var packet = reader.read()   while(packet) {     //do something with fully parsed packet   } }) ```   here's a more full featured example:  let's assume our 'packet' for our protocol is 32-bit Big Endian length-prefixed strings so a 'hello world' packet would look something like [length, string] `[0, 0, 0 0x0B, h, e, l, l, o, w, o, r, l, d]`  ```js var Transform = require('stream').Transform var Reader = require('packet-reader') var reader = new Reader() var parser = new Transform() parser._transform = function(chunk, encoding, cb) {   reader.addChunk(chunk)   var packet = reader.read()   while(packet) {     this.push(packet.toString('utf8'))     packet = reader.read()   }   cb() }  var server = net.createServer(function(socket) {   socket.pipe(parser).pipe(stdout) })  ```  There are a few config options for setting optional pre-length padding byte.  Read the tests for details.  ## License  MIT  Copyright 2015 Brian M. Carlson All rights reserved.

To access it, do the following:  ```js var types = require('pg').types ```  Generally what you'll want to do is override how a specific data-type is parsed and turned into a JavaScript type.  By default the PostgreSQL backend server returns everything as strings.  Every data type corresponds to a unique `OID` within the server, and these `OIDs` are sent back with the query response.  So, you need to match a particluar `OID` to a function you'd like to use to take the raw text input and produce a valid JavaScript object as a result. `null` values are never parsed.  Let's do something I commonly like to do on projects: return 64-bit integers `(int8)` as JavaScript integers.  Because JavaScript doesn't have support for 64-bit integers node-postgres cannot confidently parse `int8` data type results as numbers because if you have a _huge_ number it will overflow and the result you'd get back from node-postgres would not be the result in the datbase.  That would be a __very bad thing__ so node-postgres just returns `int8` results as strings and leaves the parsing up to you.  Let's say that you know you don't and wont ever have numbers greater than `int4` in your database, but you're tired of recieving results from the `COUNT(*)` function as strings (because that function returns `int8`).  You would do this:  ```js var types = require('pg').types types.setTypeParser(20, function(val) {   return parseInt(val) }) ```  __boom__: now you get numbers instead of strings.  Just as another example -- not saying this is a good idea -- let's say you want to return all dates from your database as [moment](http://momentjs.com/docs/) objects.  Okay, do this:  ```js var types = require('pg').types var moment = require('moment') var parseFn = function(val) {    return val === null ? null : moment(val) } types.setTypeParser(types.builtins.TIMESTAMPTZ, parseFn) types.setTypeParser(types.builtins.TIMESTAMP, parseFn) ``` _note: I've never done that with my dates, and I'm not 100% sure moment can parse all the date strings returned from postgres.  It's just an example!_  If you're thinking 'gee, this seems pretty handy, but how can I get a list of all the OIDs in the database and what they correspond to?!?!?!' worry not:  ```bash $ psql -c 'select typname, oid, typarray from pg_type order by oid' ```  If you want to find out the OID of a specific type:  ```bash $ psql -c 'select typname, oid, typarray from pg_type where typname = 'daterange' order by oid' ```  :smile:  ## license  The MIT License (MIT)  Copyright (c) 2014 Brian M.

"pgpass@1.0.2","MIT","Copyright (c) 2013-2016 Hannes Hörl","https://github.com/hoegaarden/pgpass","# pgpass  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hoegaarden/pgpass.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hoegaarden/pgpass)  ## Install  ```sh npm install pgpass ```  ## Usage ```js var pgPass = require('pgpass');  var connInfo = {   'host' : 'pgserver' ,   'user' : 'the_user_name' , };  pgPass(connInfo, function(pass){   conn_info.password = pass;   // connect to postgresql server }); ```  ## Description  This module tries to read the `~/.pgpass` file (or the equivalent for windows systems). If the environment variable `PGPASSFILE` is set, this file is used instead. If everything goes right, the password from said file is passed to the callback; if the password cannot be read `undefined` is passed to the callback.  Cases where `undefined` is returned:  - the environment variable `PGPASSWORD` is set - the file cannot be read (wrong permissions, no such file, ...) - for non windows systems: the file is write-/readable by the group or by other users - there is no matching line for the given connection info  There should be no need to use this module directly; it is already included in `node-postgresq`.  ## Configuration  The module reads the environment variable `PGPASS_NO_DEESCAPE` to decide if the the read tokens from the password file should be de-escaped or not. Default is to do de-escaping. For further information on this see [this commit](https://github.com/postgres/postgres/commit/8d15e3ec4fcb735875a8a70a09ec0c62153c3329).   ## Tests  There are tests in `./test/`; including linting and coverage testing. Running `npm test` runs:  - `jshint` - `mocha` tests - `jscoverage` and `mocha -R html-cov`  You can see the coverage report in `coverage.html`.   ## Development, Patches, Bugs, ...  If you find Bugs or have improvments, please feel free to open a issue on github. If you provide a pull request, I'm more than happy to merge them, just make sure to add tests for your changes.  ## Links  - https://github.com/hoegaarden/node-pgpass - http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/libpq-pgpass.html - https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Pgpass - https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/master/src/interfaces/libpq/fe-connect.c  ## License  Copyright (c) 2013-2016 Hannes Hörl  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.
